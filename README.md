# Appointment Managment Web Application

This is a Managing Appointments Web App designed for pediatricians who works at the Little Sunshine Pediatric Clinic. I have created a form that lets this app user add appointments, read a list of appointments from a file and also delete, modify, search, and sort those appointments.
I adopted React.js which is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that display dynamic data in this project. Additional libraries and frameworks that I used are Bootstrap, Lodash, Jquery and popper.js and the react-moment for manipulating dates and times in JavaScript.
